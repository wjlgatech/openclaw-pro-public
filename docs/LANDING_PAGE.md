### Why Your AI Agent Is Burning Money 🔥

**The Hidden Cost Killers:**

|---------|--------|---------------------|

| Single model | Using Opus for everything | 20x more than needed |
| No visibility | Don't know where tokens go | Surprise $500 bills |

**Sound familiar?** You're not alone. Most AI agent users discover this the hard way.
