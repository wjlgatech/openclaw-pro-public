### Launch Tweet Thread

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
```
I was paying $500/night for my AI agent to do research.

Last night it cost me $6.

Here's the exact config that reduced my costs by 97%: 🧵
```

**Tweet 2:**
```
The problem: Context bloat.

Every message was loading:
- Full SOUL.md
- Full USER.md  
- Full MEMORY.md
- Full conversation history

That's 50KB+ of tokens. Every. Single. Time.
```

**Tweet 3:**
```
Solution #1: Multi-model routing

Instead of using Claude Opus for everything:
- 85% Haiku (basic tasks) → $0.0008/1K
- 10% Sonnet (writing/code) → $0.003/1K
- 5% Opus (complex) → $0.015/1K
- 0% Local (heartbeats) → FREE

Same results. 20x cheaper.
```

**Tweet 4:**
```
Solution #2: Local LLM for heartbeats

My agent was pinging every 30 min with FULL context.

$2-3/day just sitting IDLE.

Now? Heartbeats run on Ollama locally.

Cost: $0.
```

**Tweet 5:**
```
Solution #3: Selective context loading

Don't load MEMORY.md for a heartbeat check.
Don't load SOUL.md for file organization.

Load what you need. Nothing more.

Saved 80% of my context overhead.
```

**Tweet 6:**
```
The results:

Before → After
$500/night → $6
$2-3/day idle → $0
$90+/month → <$10

That's 97% savings.
```

**Tweet 7 (CTA):**

I've packaged all of this into Enterprise OpenClaw.

### Daily Content Ideas

**Monday - Pain Point:**
```
"My AI agent spent $47 on a task that should have cost $0.50"

This is what happens when you don't optimize tokens.

**Tuesday - Tutorial:**
```
How to set up multi-model routing in 5 minutes:

1. Define your models
2. Set routing rules
3. Default to Haiku
4. Watch costs drop

```

**Wednesday - Social Proof:**
```
Another Enterprise OpenClaw user just DM'd me:

"I've been running for 2 weeks. My Claude bill went from $180 to $12."

That's $2,000/year saved.

What would YOU do with an extra $2K? 👇
```

**Thursday - Myth Busting:**
```
"You need Opus for good results"

Wrong.

Haiku handles 85% of tasks just fine:
- Research
- Data extraction  
- File organization
- Basic Q&A

Save Opus for what actually needs it.
```

**Friday - Behind the Scenes:**
```
Building Enterprise OpenClaw in public.

This week:
- Added token dashboard ✓
- Fixed cache bug ✓
- 14 new users ✓

### Launch Post

```
I discovered my AI agent was costing me $500/night.

Not because I was running complex tasks.
Just because of poor token management.

After 2 weeks of optimization, I got the same results for $6.

Here's what I learned:

1️⃣ CONTEXT BLOAT IS THE KILLER
Every message loaded 50KB of context files.
Every heartbeat reloaded everything.
$2-3/day just to sit idle.

2️⃣ ONE MODEL DOESN'T FIT ALL
Using Claude Opus for everything is like taking a Ferrari to get groceries.
85% of tasks work fine on Haiku (20x cheaper).

3️⃣ LOCAL LLMs FOR FREE OPERATIONS
Heartbeats, file organization, basic checks.
Run them on Ollama. Cost: $0.

The ROI? 97% cost reduction.

I've packaged these learnings into Enterprise OpenClaw - an open-source platform with enterprise token optimization.

If you're building AI agents and burning money on tokens, this might save you thousands.

### Launch Post (r/artificial)

**Title:** I reduced my AI agent costs by 97% - here's how (open source)

```
Hey r/artificial,

Been running AI agents for a few months and got hit with some brutal bills. One night cost me $500 for a research task that should have been $6.

After diving deep into where the tokens were going, I found:

1. Context bloat - loading full memory/soul/user files on EVERY message
2. Expensive heartbeats - full context reload every 30 minutes = $2-3/day idle
3. Single model - using Opus for basic tasks that Haiku handles fine

I've built Enterprise OpenClaw to solve this:
- Multi-model routing (85% Haiku, 10% Sonnet, 5% Opus)
- Local LLM for heartbeats (free)
- Token dashboard with budget alerts
- Context optimization

Open source core, enterprise features for power users.

Docs: [link]

Happy to answer questions about the architecture or token optimization strategies.

3. "Show HN: Open-source AI agent platform with token optimization"

### Post Text

Hi HN,

I built Enterprise OpenClaw after getting a $500 overnight bill from my AI agent doing basic research.

The culprit? Poor token management:
- Loading 50KB context on every message
- Using Claude Opus for tasks Haiku could handle
- Expensive heartbeats every 30 minutes

Enterprise OpenClaw fixes this with:
- Multi-model routing (auto-select cheapest model that works)
- Local LLM for heartbeats (free)
- Real-time token dashboard
- Budget alerts and limits

Open source core (Apache 2.0), enterprise features for power users.

Tech stack: TypeScript, Node.js, LanceDB (vector store)

GitHub: [link]
Demo: [link]

Would love feedback on the architecture and token optimization approach.
